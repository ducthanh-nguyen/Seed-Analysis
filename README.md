#### Tasks
- Data Preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Mean and standard deviation of each type
- Correlations among the numerical columns for each wheat variety
- K-means clustering on the data
- Principal Component Analysis on the data

#### Tools
Python for Data Preparation, EDA and Analysis

#### Data Set
The dataset for this project consists of kernels belonging to three different varieties of wheat:
Kama, Rosa and Canadian. It has totally 210 kernels with each wheat variety being represented by 70
specimens. A soft X-ray technique and GRAINS package were used to construct 7 real-valued
attributes, measures of geometrical properties of kernels. (1) area, (2) perimeter, (3) compactness,
(4) length, (5) width, (6) asymmetry coefficient, and (7) length of kernel groove. Example X-ray
images of kernels is shown below:
